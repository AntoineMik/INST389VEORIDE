# Veoride Scooters Usage & The UMD Bus Transportation System


## Abstract 

UMD introduced VeoRide scooters in late 2019, and because this program is relatively new, the Department of Transportation Services wants more insight into how the campus community uses it, and how they can improve its structure to better suit user trends. Students, staff, and visitors of the University of Maryland can download the VeoRide app and pay a small fee to ride around campus. DOTS collected ride data for 62 days in October 2019 and October 2020, which includes ride counts, event times, trips, routes, and status changes, but weâ€™re yet to have an in-depth comparison of this data. Using this dataset, our team will analyze how pandemic behavior & regulations affected scooter activity on campus. Specifically, we will explore and visualize how the pandemic affected popular ride routes, popular ride start and end locations, and common UMD Campus entrances and exits. Additionally, if time allows, we will analyze how the E-Scooters are being used with campus transportation. We hope that our work provides valuable insight into how the E-Scooter system is used on campus and helps the UMD Department of Transportation improve transportation services on and around campus.
